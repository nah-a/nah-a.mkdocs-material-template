# mkdocs-material-template
___

## purpose
A template for the quick start setup for mkdocs-material to fork from to allow for an easy setup.  
You can fork this template into any repository you want to create your own mkdocs-material site.  
Once that's done, you should be able to build and deploy with docker & docker-compose.  

## simple setup

### prerequisites

- Docker installed locally; Docker Desktop, a local VM with Docker, however you please
- A command line terminal

### steps

Fork this repository into a new repository. `git clone` that repository onto your local machine.  
Once cloned locally, the easiest way is to use docker-compose to build and bring up the site.  

```
docker-compose -f /path/to/repo/docker-compose-template.yml build  
docker-compose -f /path/to/repo/docker-compose up (-d will detach the service)  
```
